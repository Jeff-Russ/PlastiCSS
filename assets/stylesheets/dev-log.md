## WORKING

buttons
.img-rounded
.img-circle
.img-thumbnail

## NOT WORKING IN ROUTESTRAP

`<tr class="success">`
`<table>` has `margin-bottom: 20px;`. why?
forms <label> / <input> are not stacked.. possibly ::after and ::before
`alert-COLOR` with `alert-link`
.panel <p> left margin is too small or something
.row inside .col* overflows it on the left
missing space between <strong> then  <a class="alert-link"> text (not margin or padding i dont think)

## NOT WORKING ANYWHERE

`progress-striped` not visible
`media-object` not visible
.panel might have missing padding
